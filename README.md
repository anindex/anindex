### Hi! I am An ðŸ‘‹

My research lies in the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. I aim to scale Robot Learning to big data regime!!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. Student at TU Darmstadt, advised by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently researching in how to learn robot motor skills from heterogeneous expert data and combining generative modelling algorithms and robotics.

ðŸ’¬ If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:an@robot-learning.de).
