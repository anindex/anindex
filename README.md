### Hi! I am An ðŸ‘‹

My research lies at the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. I aim to scale robot planning to a long-horizon, high-dimensional state space, number of plans, and number of agents.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Student at TU Darmstadt, advised by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters).
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently playing around with learning robot motor skills from heterogeneous expert data.
- ðŸŒ± I'm having fun with entropic OT in various ML problems.
- :whale: Batching robotics planning problems? GPUs come to the rescue :D
