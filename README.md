### Hi! I am An 👋

My research lies in the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. I am exploring new perspectives of Computational Geometry applying in Robotics.

- 🔭 I’m a Ph.D. Student at TU Darmstadt, advised by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters).
- 🌱 I’m currently finding out how to learn robot motor skills from heterogeneous expert data.
- :whale: Wanna solving robotics problems like old times with only linear programs?

💬 If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:an@robot-learning.de).
