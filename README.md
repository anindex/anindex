### Hi! I am An ðŸ‘‹

My research lies in the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. I aim to scale robot planning to long-horizon, high-dimensional state-space, number of plans, and number of agents.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Student at TU Darmstadt, advised by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finding out how to learn robot motor skills from heterogeneous expert data.
- :whale: I'm currently batching various update rules of various robotics planning problems :)

ðŸ’¬ If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:an@robot-learning.de).
