# Hi! I’m An 👋

My research sits at the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning, with a focus on scaling robot learning & motion planning to long-horizon tasks, high-dimensional state spaces, large plan sets, and multimodal (often non-convex) solution landscapes. I’m especially interested in vectorized/batched planning and optimization (e.g., tensorized search) and in combining algorithmic structure with modern generative models (diffusion/flow-matching) to build planners and policies that are efficient, robust, and deployable, recently with a strong emphasis on humanoid locomotion and manipulation.

Outside of robotics, I’m also a hobbyist in **numerical physics/general relativity**: I build simulation code to study dynamical processes in curved spacetime (e.g., Kerr black holes and the Penrose process), and I enjoy the “physics-style” workflow of modeling, validation, and reproducible computational experiments.
